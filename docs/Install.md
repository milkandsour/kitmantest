# Install

In order to have fun with what I did, you need globally the latest stable of:

- grunt (grunt-cli v1.2.0, grunt v1.0.1)
- node (nodejs V6.2.2)
- java

That is if you want to run acceptance test, works with the build, develop.
It is optional, the build and aource files are inside the build and src folder.

The setup may not work on windows, I do not have a windows laptop at home, and I am a Ubuntu user.

#### install
```
npm install
```
